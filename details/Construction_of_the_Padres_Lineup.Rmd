` `	The dataset that was used to create the hits and runs functions of our Simulation of the San Diego Padres 2019 Baseball Season was taken from [Baseball Reference](https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/SDP/2019.shtml)


` `	The lineup was constructed to be as close to an average 2019 Padres lineup as possible. Players that played at least 140 out of 162 games were taken as being everyday players, so they were placed in the nine-player lineup based on where they usually hit in the lineup after looking at random lineups played by the Padres in 2019, which was found from [MLB At Bat](https://www.mlb.com/padres/scores/2019-08-07) 
These players were: Hunter Renfroe (2nd in the lineup, played 140 games), Manny Machado (3rd in the lineup, played 156 games), Eric Hosmer (4th in the lineup, played 160 games), Manuel Margot (5th in the lineup, played 151 games), Wil Myers (6th in the lineup, played 155 games)


` `	Where constructing the lineup became more complicated was with players who played in a fair number of games but were in a platoon situation, were defensive replacements late in games, were pinch hitters, or were injury replacement. This required more judgement to combine and average players into the lineup that would represent a typical Padres lineup in 2019.
The final combinations were: Fernando Tatis Jr./Luis Urias (1st in the lineup, played 84 and 71 games, respectively; Urias was the primary replacement for Tatis Jr. after his injury), Austin Hedges/Framil Reyes (7th in the lineup, played 102 and 99 games, respectively), Ian Kinsler/Greg Garcia (8th in the lineup, played 87 and 134 games, respectively; Garcia was often a defensive replacement for Kinsler and they had a similar number of actual at bats) 

` `	Finally, it is worth noting that because the Padres play in the National League, their pitchers hit unless they are removed from the game. So, to fill out lineup spot, the starting pitchers were averaged (Joey Lucchesi, Eric Lauer, Chris Paddack, Cal Quantrill, and Matt Strahm). Then that average was averaged with Josh Naylor who played the most games (94) of a player who had not been included in the dataset.

` `	The player’s on base percentage (OBP, chance of not making an out) was included either as the player’s raw value (everyday players) or an average of the player’s combined OBP. From there, the players’ chance of making it to first base (singles and walks), second base (doubles), third base (triples), and home to score a run (home runs), were taken as the proportion of the time they achieved those outcome(s) over their total number of hits plus walks (averaged over the totals for the combination players).
