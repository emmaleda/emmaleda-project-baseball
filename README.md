Emma Grossman and Leah Marcus

The primary objective of the project is to simulate the 2019 season of the San Diego Padres based on a simulation of their batting lineup. Hitters can be represented individually by a Bernoulli random variable, where p will equal the probability of not making an out (so p = on base percentage). The first level of the simulation will represent whether a player is successful in getting a hit/not making an out.
