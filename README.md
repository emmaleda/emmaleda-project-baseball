## Baseball

The primary objective of the project is to simulate the 2019 season of the San Diego Padres based on a simulation of their average batting lineup. Our secondary objective is to compare our simulation of the Padres' 2019 Season to a simulation in which their best hitter, Fernando Tatis Jr., was not injured halfway through the 2019 season and see if the Padres would have made it to the playoffs if he was able to play the entire season. To simulate this, we generated many random variables from a uniform distribution and compared those to player's OBP: this determined if they made an out or reached base; we then simulated the base each player made it to and multiplied these vectors together to get 0's if a player got out and 1, 2, 3, or 4 representing the base they made it to if they got a hit. We calculated the hits obtained per inning, translated that into the runs score, and summed up the total runs scored in the game to compare to their adjusted average runs allowed in the 2019 season to determine if they won or lost. Then, we repeated this 162 times to represent a season and simulated 250 seasons to come up with the average games won for each of the two objectives.

## Organization

Required packages are `devtools`, `tidyverse` and `here`.

The code to view the functions that simulate the Season is in [R/simulation-functions.R](R/simulation-functions.R) and this file must be run first. To run the simulation, head to [results/results.R](results/results.R); the code in this file takes a while to run (approx. 12 minutes - we did try alternate variations of code to speed this up, but ultimately this was the fastest when timed with `bench::mark`). 

The final results and graphs can be viewed [results/plot_and_mean.md](results/plot_and_mean.md).

The functions created for this simulation are `game_won(data, OBP, First, Second, Third, Home, avg_runs_allowed)` and `season(data, OBP, First, Second, Third, Home, avg_runs_allowed)`. In the file [results/results.R](results/results.R), we have provided the data frame and appropriate arguments for the Padres' 2019 season, but this can also be used to simulate a game for another team, as long as the necessary statistics have been provided. `game_won()` should be used to simulate whether a team won or lost a game and `season()` should be used to simulate games 162 times for the desired team.
