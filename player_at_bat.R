# notes: 
# 1. n_players needs to be motified so that it restarts with 
#    player 1 once player 9 has hit
#     -> complete
#        and we now have a solution for what to do if a player
#        bats twice in one inning
# 2. currently, we've recorded whether a player has not made an out,
#    which means we know they made it to a base, but
#    just because they made it to a base, doesn't mean they 
#    scored a run, so this needs to be modified as well
#     -> complete
# 3. we'll stick to base to base to start with scoring runs, so any value
#    above 3 would represent (n - 3) runs scored before an inning ends
# 4. because runs right now are counted as whole numbers based on hits per
#    inning being above 3, the expected runs per game that the Padres
#    pitchers gave up will be rounded up to 5, so scoring 5 or more runs
#    results in a win
# 5. this should eventually be modified using a randomized test so that
#    13% of the time when the Padres score exactly 4 runs they get a win,
#    since the Padres gave up 4.87 runs per game in 2019
