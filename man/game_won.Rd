\title{Did They Win the Game?}
\usage{
game_won(data, OBP, First, Second, Third, Home, avg_runs_allowed)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{dataframe with 9 rows; Must have columns named "OBP", "First", "Second", "Third" and "Home" in which the values are probabilites;
the probabilities provided in "First", "Second", "Third" and "Home" should add to 1 for each player}

\item{OBP}{column of length 9 that has each player's on-base percentage}

\item{First}{column of length 9 that has each player's probability of getting to First base}

\item{Second}{column of length 9 that has each player's probability of getting to Second base}

\item{Third}{column of length 9 that has each player's probability of getting to Third base}

\item{Home}{column of length 9 that has each player's probability of getting to Home base}

\item{avg_runs_allowed}{a numeric value that is the average runs allowed by a team per game}
}
\value{
The value is a double, either zero or one, in which zero indicates they lost and one indicates they won
