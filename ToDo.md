# Milestones:

1.) Gather the relevant data on a typical Padres lineup in 2019 (Week 5)

2.) Set up a toy example to simulate one at bat (Week 5)

3.) Set up a function to simulate one inning (where the inning ends after three outs are made) (Week 6)

4.) Include the Padres 2019 lineup in the function simulating an inning (Week 6)

5.) Set up a function to record the number of runs scored in each inning and then sum that over the 9 innings for the game total. This will then be compared to the 
Padres 2019 Runs Allowed per game (4.87) to determine whether they won or lost the game (Week 6)

6.) Simulate many seasons of the Padres 2019 season (162 games) to see they predicted number of games won each season (Week 7)

7.) Make adjustments to the simulation to make it more accurate/better reflect a baseball game (add different hit types to allow players to advance multiple bases,
increase the accuracy of the batting lineup by reweighting the hitting statistics, randomizing the lineup order) (Week 7 and Week 8)

8.) Document the work and finish deliverables (Week 9 and Week 10)
